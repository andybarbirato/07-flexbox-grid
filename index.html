                    <p>I was born and raised in Austria, but early fell in love with Canada where I moved in 2018 with my wife Izabela and where we still live with our two dogs, Kiara and Lilou. While living in Vancouver is awesome, no idea where the winds will carry us next (possibly quite literally). We are world citizens and not tied to a specific place, home is where the heart is, and our 5 year plan involves selling our assets, buying a sailboat, and going global/remote, hence the where the winds might carry us.</p>

                <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                    <p>My Passions are all more or less related to sustainability, traveling by sailboat, eating a plant-based diet and finding sustainable ways for the energy future of our world. I love web development and the capability it provides to drive products and messages online to people that need to see and hear them. Yes, these are actually my passions and hobbies - but when I'm not getting lost in those I can always be found with my nose in a book, on a hike, or just daydreaming with a cup of tea in my hand.</p>

                <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                    <p>A fun fact: The most terrifying moment of my life was when I ahd proposed to my wife (she said yes). We were in Brazil at the time, Izabela being Brazilian. After  we stayed in her fathers' house who was also traveling. Izabela had to work and I was home alone for a few days with her dog Bell. Her dad, stepmother and little brother showed up out of the blue, neither of whom I had ever met. I didn't speak Portuguese, and her dad didn't speak English. After an hour of hands-and-feet talk, I finally managed to have the courage to ask him if I could marry his daughter with the one sentence I knew in Portuguese and which Izabela had drilled into my via WhatsApp audios before they had arrived.</p>
